     <p>Client-Server Architecture is a form of distributrd computing where requesters
       (clients) depend on a number of providers (servers) for various services or resources,
       such as database, applications, security, printing, and backups. Typically, there is at
       least one server that provides central authentication services. These servers also provide
       access to shared files, printers, hardware storage,  and applications.</p>

       <p style="color:green">Note: In a client-server architecture, the processing power,
         management services, and administrative functions can be concentrated when needed,
         while clients can still perform many basic end-user tasks on their own. In the
         client-server architecture, additional investment is required for an accelerated
         deployment of new resources to meet sudden changes during demand upsurge.</p>

         <p>When a user runs an application from the cloud, it is part of a client-server
           application. However, cloud computing can provide increased performance, flexibility,
           and significant cost savings, because application hosting and support is the
           responsibility of the cloud service provider, and the amount of available resources appears
           to be infinite to the consumer.</p>
