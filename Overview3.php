              <center><h1><u>Deployment Model</u></h1></center>
              
              <p><b>“The cloud has delivered scalable, elastic and cost-efficient computing to businesses of all sizes. It is a type of computing that mainly depends on resource sharing rather than handling of application. Taking the advantage of resource sharing, cloud computing is able to achieve consistency and economies of scale”.  </b></p>
              
              <p>The types of cloud computing are classified based on two models. Cloud computing service models and cloud computing deployment models. </p>
              
              <h2><u>Deployment Model:</u></h2>
              <p><b>The deployment models represent the cloud hosting environment which is mainly distinguished by the proprietorship, size, access criteria, architecture and SLA.  </b></p>
              
              <p><b>Deployment model generally focuses on- </b></p>
              
              <ul>
                  <li>Purpose of cloud service.</li>
                  <li>Structure of cloud.</li>
                  <li>The nature of   cloud.</li>
                  <li>Controls operating cost.</li>
                  <li>Workload characterization.</li>
                  <li>Nonfunctional business requirements.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h2><u>Cloud Deployment Implications: </u></h2>
              <p>The deployment models have numerous implications. Following implications are needed to be considered irrespective of type of deployment model:- </p>
              
              <ul>
              <li><b>Network Dependency:</b> A reliable and secure network is highly desirable for good performance whether choice is off, on-site or off-shore.</li> 
 
                  <li><b>IT skills:</b> In order to manage various user devices that access cloud, resources with traditional IT skills are required, along with updation of existing resources.

                  <br>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Risk:</b> Services in cloud has more risk compared to traditional system. The risk involvement is more due to multi –tenant environment supported by cloud .Multi-tenancy increases the risk since a single machine may be shared by the workloads of any combination of users.</li> 
 
 
                  <li><b>Location of workload:</b> Portability of workloads is their between nodes without any inconvenience to the clients. Mostly the cloud vendors take care of workload location but as a user for efficient resource management one should pay more attention to where the workload is hosted.</li>

              </ul>
              
              <h2><u> Types of Deployment Model</u></h2>
              <p>On the basis of how exclusive the computing resources are made available to a Consumer, cloud infrastructure may be operated as one of the following: public cloud, private cloud, community cloud, or hybrid. This categorization was in accordance of NIST definition.</p>
