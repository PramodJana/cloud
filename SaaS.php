              <center><u><h1>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h1></u></center>
              <p>SaaS is the capability to use the provider’s applications running on an cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a web browser. As in the case of PaaS, the customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure (Servers, Storage, OS , networks) or the application features. The customer can however, configure user-specific application parameters and settings.</p>

              <h3>SaaS Characteristics</h3>
              <ul>
              <li>For software delivery “one to many” model is used.</li>
              <li>Management of software is done from a centralized location.</li>
              <li>Access to application is via the internet.</li>
              <li>The end users need not worry about software patches and upgrades </li>
              <li>To enable integration with other applications, application programming interfaces (APIs) is used.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3>Benefits </h3>
              <ul>
              <li>Minimal planning and is easy to setup, as applications are usually simple in usage and readymade.</li>
              <li>Deployment is fast as the software is fully provisioned on demand.</li>
              <li>The customer does not need to worry about the management of applications, as this is all handled by the provider.</li> 
              <li>Dynamic Scalability</li>
              <li>Device independence.</li>
              <li>Cost effective Cloud service as you only lease the software and not the resource.</li>
              <li>Collaborative, it allows multiple sharing of information.</li>
              <li>Constant Updates</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Disadvantage   <br>
               It‟s a „what you see is what you get‟ form of cloud computing. </h3>
              <ol type="i">
              <li>Dependent on browser capabilities.</li>
              <li>Security concern is too high.</li>
              <li>Less customizable, compare to cloud at the infrastructure and platform level.</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The customer has no control over the system processing its data.</li>
                      <li>There is no control over which customers use the software; 
                          the software is used by a large amount of users.</li>
                      <li>Little or no control over the parameters of deployed software.</li>
                      <li>Vendor specific i.e. difficult to integrate.</li> 
                      <li>Cloud provider has full access to customer’s data, unless cryptography is used.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
              </ol>

              <p>
              <b>Example 1</b><br>
                  Google docs: Google docs provides a web-based application to edit documents, spreadsheets or to create presentation 
                  slides. All these features can be accessed by simply creating an account on google. For advanced features, 
                  an user may be asked to pay based on usage.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              <b>Example 2</b><br>
                  Google Apps is another application provided in the SaaS model. One of the applications provided by Google Apps is
                  the email service. A business planning to provide email services to its employees can do so by creating
                  a subscription account on Google Apps. The organization will only be paying based on the number of email accounts. 
                  Google Apps will take care of all hardware, software, and email application maintainance.
