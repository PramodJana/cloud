              <center><u><h1>Cloud Computing and Outsourcing</h1></u></center>
              <p>The justification for IT outsourcing and cloud computing has been instrumental in lowering of costs. Contracting a business or IT function to another organization characterizes outsourcing. Cloud-Sourcing is about leveraging of services hosted at third-party site for computing resources or applications. It replaces the need for dedicated IT capabilities and staff, which are using more expensive.</p>
              
              <p>Cloud-sourcing can provide substantial economic benefits, but there are disadvantages to consider too such as Security, loss of control, and performance. However, it is important to understand the similarities and differences between the two, as shown in table below,</p>

             <p> It is important to realize that there are compliance and government regulations for location of data, and it applies to both cloud computing and outsourcing.</p>

<p>Other concerns for both are:</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Security at a vendor site</li>
<li>Loss of control</li>
<li>Latency of using an application at a remote site</li>
