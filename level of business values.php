              <p>In general, business owners, profit-center heads, and Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) prefer the concept of cloud computing due to economic savings, pay-per-use billings, and absence of fixed costs. However, a disadvantages of cloud computing is that the cloud costs are variable and do not linearly increase or decrease  with change in the utilization pattern, making it difficult to forecast the billing amount each month. From a business viewpoint, cloud computing offers value to an organization at three different levels. These are described in Table below</p>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Basic Level (Utility Level Value)</td>
      <td>Consumer organizations benefits from fundamental features of cloud such as lower IT costs, higher service levels, scalability to meet peak load, absence of fixed or capital expenses, and pay-per-use billing. Focus is on labor, IT resources, and power.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Intermediate Level (Process Transformation Level Value)</td>
      <td>Enterprise find it difficult to improve business processes, because they are usually ineffectively supported by traditional in-house IT infrastructure and terms. A cloud, on the other hand, allows business units to regulate to meet their specific requirements.
<br>
For example, sales teams can use cloud-based CRM to improve sales tracking and customer relations. Human Resources (HR) departments can use cloud-based human capital management applications. Cloud users can introduce new processes by taking advantages of pooled and scalable resources in the cloud. It facilitates better collaborations between geographically-dispersed teams and users with mobile and remote access.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Advanced Level(Business Innovation Level Value)</td>
      <td>The business innovation level aims to create new value chains between organizations and customers and novel and pioneering business models. This is achieved by rewiring the way organizations can operate using cloud resources, making choices of competitive advantage, and deriving new values from cloud-based services. It can be used to collaborate between users, customers, and partners. Cloud resources can be combined to create new business eco-systems.</td>
